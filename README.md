## Icebox: 

I aimed to make an application that performs as a platform for both investors and promoters to connect with each other, follow and discuss the new trends. As well as for promoters/investors to list the investments. Investors are able to follow up per listing, invest, and track their money. 

There was also the idea of having an e-wallet per user. As an investor, the user could deposit credit into their wallet in one of the selected currencies, and invest via that platform. 

Considering the fact that I didn't have enough time, I decided to go with the minimal viable product. I made a simple user investment model that consumes the Google Maps API to visualise the location. Feeding news based on location and hashtag was an incoming API from Twitter.
